# 🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting

This project aims to forecast sales across multiple Walmart stores using historical data. By identifying seasonal trends and patterns, the model helps Walmart make informed decisions about inventory, revenue planning, and strategic investments.

## 📂 Dataset
📎 [Walmart Sales Forecast Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast/data)

The dataset contains historical sales data for 45 stores across various departments. It includes features such as store number, date, weekly sales, holiday flags, temperature, fuel prices, and economic indicators.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Walmart's sales fluctuate significantly across seasons. Without understanding these variations, the company risks:
- Overstocking or understocking inventory
- Inaccurate revenue projections
- Missed investment opportunities
- Stock price volatility due to unachieved sales targets

## 🎯 Objective
Build a model that accurately **predicts weekly sales** for each store, enabling Walmart to:
- 📊 Forecast seasonal demand
- 💰 Prevent financial losses
- 📈 Enhance stock performance by aligning targets
- 📦 Improve inventory management
- 📣 Run more effective campaigns

## ✅ Project Highlights
- Developed an **ARIMA(1,2,2)** model with **97% accuracy**
- Cleaned and aggregated data from all 45 stores to ensure high data quality
- Delivered sales predictions that support inventory optimization and strategic planning
